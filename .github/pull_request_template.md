**geOrchestra/geonetwork checklist**
<!--- In order to ease future geonetwork migrations: -->

- [ ] PR only involves cherry-picked commits from upstream.
- [ ] PR contains custom code which will soon be available in an upstream release and can be overriden => mention core-geonetwork version if possible.
- [ ] PR contains custom geOrchestra code, which need to be verified during future migrations.
  -  [ ] I have properly filled the [migration-helper-changelog.md](..%2Fgeorchestra-migration%2Fmigration-helper-changelog.md) file.
